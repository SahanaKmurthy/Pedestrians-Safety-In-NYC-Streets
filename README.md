ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This repository contains our work for the Explorer TDSP, a data science initiative focused on analyzing NYC OpenData to improve road safety. The project, hosted by the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub, National Student Data Corps, and U.S. Department of Transportation, guides participants through real-world transportation research using data-driven approaches.

This research focuses on improving pedestrian safety through data-driven insights as part of the Explorer TDSP. By analyzing pedestrian-related incidents and identifying patterns, the study aims to propose actionable solutions to enhance safety and reduce accidents. The project emphasizes understanding the factors contributing to pedestrian risks and developing targeted strategies to address them effectively.

The Jupyter Notebook contains a comprehensive analysis that combines code, data visualizations, and written reports. Together, these elements provide a detailed exploration of pedestrian safety trends and practical recommendations for improvement.

This research project was conducted as part of an accelerated research program, offering participants hands-on experience in data science by developing actionable, data-driven recommendations to improve road safety. The Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP) was made possible through the collaborative efforts of the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub (NEBDHub), National Student Data Corps (NSDC), and the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration.
